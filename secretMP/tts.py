The MuNCHER is a Mars rover replica and is on the path to collect multiple soil samples, autonomously navigate its surroundings, and stream data to a central location. The students have been working on this project for 6 weeks and have built a soil sampler mechanism, drivetrain, suspension system, and plan to take on NASA as the world's best rover.
